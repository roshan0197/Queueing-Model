# Queueing Model designed for a UK-based client
<h2> NOTE: This project contains real-time company information, some parts of which are hidden for confidentiality </h2>

This research is simulation-based research for the client. The objective of this research is to evaluate the pickup time for orders and using this evaluation, predict the workforce required and optimization of this allocation process.<br>

For evaluating the pickup time, primary data given by the client were information regarding the customers, Stock Keeping Units (SKU) categories, current demand for these products with the current resource allocation <br>

Two models were built to evaluate this pickup time. The first model gives calculates the overall time required to fulfil the orders which also provides the utilisation of resources within each sub-process. This model is capable of identifying bottleneck situations within these sub-processes. The second model assumes a queueing model, where details about individual sub-processes for each SKU are identified and measured. The way of modelling paved the way for the ad-hoc addition of new SKUs and identified bottleneck scenarios. <br>

All data processing and evaluation was done using MS Excel and VBA for iterations. Along with the working model, A Power BI model and report was also designed for the client for continuous monitoring of their resource allocation.<br>

The model designed can address the bottleneck situation wherein the demand for fulfilment is more than the supply of the workforce. <br>

Overall, this research bridges the gap between idle personnel availability during low demand and inadequate personnel availability during demand surges is highlighted enabling strategic allocation of resources.
